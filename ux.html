               <h1 class="post-title">User Experience (UX) </h1>
               <p><b>User Experience (UX)</b> refers to any interaction a user has with a product or service. UX design considers each and every element that shapes this experience, how it makes the user feel, and how easy it is for the user to accomplish their desired tasks. This could be anything from how a physical product feels in your hand, to how straightforward the checkout process is when buying something online. The goal of UX design is to create easy, efficient, relevant and all-round pleasant experiences for the user.</p>
               <p><b>User Experience</b> refers to the feeling users experience when using a product, application, system, or service. It is a broad term that can cover anything from how well the user can navigate the product, how easy it is to use, how relevant the content displayed is etc.</p>
               <p>UX designers combine market research, product development, strategy and design to create seamless user experiences for products, services and processes. They build a bridge to the customer, helping the company to better understand — and fulfil — their needs and expectations.</p>
               <h4>What are UX design principles</h4>
               <p>User Experience efforts concentrate on making the entire customer journey pleasant and productive. This begins with pressing the value of the solution so it is clear what capabilities and benefits the product can offer potential and current customersand that the value proposition is clearly desirable to the target market.</p>
               <p>User Experience aims to make this value discoverable and accessible. That includes clear wording and imagery and a short and simple path to understand a product’s potential, as well as accounting for users that may have physical limitations. Users must be able to start using the product and realizing the value as quickly as possible, even when it’s a large enterprise offering.</p>
               <p>User Experience continues refining customer interactions, removing points of friction and minimizing the required steps to complete various tasks. As the product itself matures, UX can extend beyond the bounds of the product by assisting with related tasks that directly impact the value proposition and satisfaction for the actual product experience. This refinement can also include building consistency in the product and providing as much contextual guidance as possible.</p>
               <h4>UX designer tasks and responsibilities</h4>
               <p>As a user experience designer, you’re responsible for the users’ overall satisfaction with a product. Think of yourself as the customer’s advocate, always looking for ways to improve the customer’s experience. Let’s take a look at some of the tasks and responsibilities you’ll likely encounter throughout the design process.</p>
               <p><b>1.</b> Understand the user and the brand. Think about what problem you’re trying to solve for the user (and how this aligns with brand goals).</p>
               <p><b>2.</b> Conduct user research. Identify user needs, goals, behaviors, and pain points. Tools for user research might include surveys, one-on-one interviews, focus groups, or A/B testing. At some companies, a UX researcher leads this process.</p>
               <p><b>3.</b> Analyze what you’ve learned. At this stage, you’ll build user personas based on your research to help you identify the most important elements of the product or service. Start to map out what the user flow will look like.</p>
               <p><b>4.</b> Design. As you begin to build out the design, you’ll create site maps, wireframes, or prototypes to give you and your team a better idea of what the final product will look like. At this stage, a user interface (UI) designer will add in visual or interface elements.</p>
               <p><b>5.</b> Conduct user testing. Validate the design by tracking how real users interact with the product or service (usability testing). Identify any problems with the design and develop solutions.</p>
               <p><b>6.</b> Present your work. Deliver the design solution to your client or company</p>

               </div>
               <h4>Value of UX design for product managers</h4>
               <p>UX design and product management are two sides of the same coin; UX covers the user end and product management takes care of the business side of the house. But unlike a coin, there is plenty of overlap between the two disciplines.</p>
               <p>Product managers essentially focus on the “what” part of the equation: What is the target market, what problems are the product trying to solve, what capabilities must be in place to solve those problems, what is the business model and value proposition, etc. Meanwhile, UX concentrates on the “how” component of product development, namely, how is the user going to complete their tasks.</p>
               <p>By leaving the “how” to UX design, product management is able to spend their limited time on the many other aspects of the product to people with a more acute focus and expertise on the customer journey, usability and user interface. And by teaming up with UX design instead of trying to do it all themselves, product managers get the benefit of additional perspectives and viewpoints on creating an overall winning experience.</p>
               <p>The best relationships between product management and UX design start by performing user research and developing use cases collaboratively. This creates a unified foundation as each party goes off to work on their own areas of focus and ensures that the user experience is fully informed by the business objectives and customer needs.</p>

               </div>
               <p><p><b>User Experience Designers</b> leverage a wide range of technical and workplace skills to bring a successful product or service to market (or improve upon an existing product). Many of these skills transfer from other fields, so even if you’re new to UX design, you’ve likely developed a few already. Focus on these essential skills, and you can begin to build a strong foundation for a career.</p>
