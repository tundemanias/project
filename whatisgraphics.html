               <h1 class="post-title">What is Graphics Design </h1>
               <p>Graphic design is a craft where professionals create visual content to communicate messages. By applying visual hierarchy and page layout techniques, designers use typography and pictures to meet users’ specific needs and focus on the logic of displaying elements in interactive designs, to optimize the user experience.</p>
               <p>According to <b>American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA)</b>, graphic design is defined as “the art and practice of planning and projecting ideas and experiences with visual and textual content.” In other terms, graphic design communicates certain ideas or messages in a visual way. These visuals can be as simple as a business logo, or as complex as page layouts on a website.</p>
               <p>“Graphic design takes graphical and textual elements and implements them into multiple types of media,” says designer <b>Alexandros Clufetos</b>, when asked to elaborate on the graphic design definition. “It helps the producer connect with the consumer. It conveys the message of the project, event, campaign or product.” And can be used by companies to promote and sell products through advertising, by websites to convey complicated information in a digestible way through infographics, or by businesses to develop an identity through branding, among other things.</p>
               <h2>Graphic design basics</h2>
               <p>To better understand the meaning of graphic design, it is important to be aware of the elements and principles that make up design. Elements are used in conjunction or opposition with each other to create visually striking and impactful designs.
                <b>These graphic design elements include</b>:</p>
                <div class="blog-sub-inside-image">
                    <img src="images/graphics 2.png" alt="blog backgroun image" class="blog-bg">
                </div>
                <p>Graphic designers also adhere to the principles of design, which are essentially a set of guidelines that help a design achieve effective composition. These basic principles aid in creating balance and stability for the piece of work.
                <b>These graphic design principles include</b>:</p>

                </div>
                <p>Graphic design is composed of many fields and specializations, ranging from print and web design to animation and motion graphics. Graphic design offers opportunities and options for individuals of almost any interest. Now we’re living in the digital age, which has given birth to several new types of graphic design.</p>
                <div class="blog-sub-inside-image">
                    <img src="images/graphics 4.png" alt="blog backgroun image" class="blog-bg">
                </div>
                <p><b>1. Visual Identity Graphic Design: </b>A brand is a relationship between a business or organization and its audience. A brand identity is how the organization communicates its personality, tone and essence, as well as memories, feelings and gests . Visual identity graphic design is exactly that the visual rudiments of brand identity that act as the face of a brand to communicate those impalpable rates through images, shapes and color.</p>
                <P>Designers that specialize in visual identity graphic design collaborate with brand stakeholders to create assets like logos, typography, color palettes and image libraries that represent a brand’s personality. In addition to the standard business cards and corporate stationary, designers often develop a set of visual brand guidelines (style guides) that describe best practices and provide examples of visual branding applied across various media. These guidelines help to ensure brand consistency throughout future applications.</P>
                <P>Visual identity design is one of the most common types of design. Visual identity graphic contrivers must retain a general knowledge of all types of graphic design in order to produce design rudiments that are suitable across all visual media. They also need excellent communication, abstract and creative skills, and a passion for researching industries, organizations, trends and challengers.</P>
                <P><b>2. Marketing & Advertising Graphic Design: </b>When most people think of graphic design, they think of designs created for marketing and advertising. Companies depend on successful marketing efforts to tap into their target audience’s decision-making process. Great marketing engages people based on the wants, needs, awareness and satisfaction they have about a product, service or brand. Since people will always find visual content more engaging, graphic design helps organizations promote and communicate more effectively.</P>
                <p>Marketing designers work with company possessors, directors, managers or marketing professionals to produce means for marketing strategies. They might work alone or as part of an in- house or creative platoon. Contrivers can specialize in a specific type of media( vehicle wraps or magazine advertisements, for illustration) or produce a broad multifariousness of collateral for print, digital, and beyond. While traditionally print- centered, this type of design has grown to include further digital means, especially for use in content marketing and digital advertising.</p>
                <div class="blog-sub-inside-image">
                    <img src="images/graphics 5.png" alt="blog backgroun image" class="blog-bg">
                </div>
                <p>Marketing designers need excellent communication, problem- solving and time operation skills. In addition to being complete in several graphic design, layout and presentation apps, you must also be familiar with production for print and online surroundings. Entry- level positions in this area are a great way for new designers to learn processes and acquire precious skills and experience.</p>
                <p><b>3. User Interface Graphic Design: </b>A user interface (UI) is how a user interacts with a device or application. UI design is the process of designing interfaces to make them easy to use and provide a user-friendly experience.</p>
                <p>A UI includes all of the things a user interacts with—the screen, keyboard and mouse—but in the context of graphic design, UI design focuses on the user’s visual experience and the design of on-screen graphic elements like buttons, menus, micro-interactions, and more. It’s a UI designer’s job to balance aesthetic appeal with technical functionality.</p>
                <p>UI designers specialize in desktop apps, mobile apps, web apps and games. They work closely with UX (user experience) designers (who determine how the app works) and UI developers (who write code to make it work).</p>
                <div class="blog-sub-inside-image">
                    <img src="images/graphics 6.png" alt="blog backgroun image" class="blog-bg">
                </div>
                <p>UI designers must be team players backed by both serious graphic design skills and an excellent understanding of UI/ UX principles, responsive design and web development. In addition to plates apps, they need knowledge of programming languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
                <p><b>4. Publication Graphic Design: </b>Publications are long-form pieces that communicate with an audience through public distribution. They have traditionally been a print medium. Publication design is a classic type of design—think books, newspapers, magazines and catalogs. However, there’s recently been a significant rise in digital publishing.</p>
                <div class="blog-sub-inside-image">
                    <img src="images/graphics 7.png" alt="blog backgroun image" class="blog-bg">
                </div>
                <p>Publication designers must possess excellent communication, layout and organizational skills. In addition to graphic design expertise, they need to understand color management, printing and digital publishing.</p>
                <p><b>5. Packaging Graphic Design: </b>Most products require some form of packaging to protect and prepare them for storage, distribution, and sale. But packaging design can also communicate directly to consumers, which makes it an extremely valuable marketing tool. Every box, bottle and bag, every can, container, or canister is a chance tell the story of a brand.</p>
                <p>Packaging designers create concepts, develop mockups and create the print-ready files for a product. This requires expert knowledge of print processes and a keen understanding of industrial design and manufacturing. Because packaging design touches so many disciplines, its not uncommon for designers to find themselves creating other assets for a product such as photography, illustrations and visual identity.</p>
                <p>Packaging designers may be a jack-of-all-trades or specialize in a specific type of packaging (like labels or beverage cans) or a specific industry (like food or children’s toys). Their work requires top-notch conceptual and problem-solving skills in addition to a strong working knowledge of print and industrial design. They must be flexible to meet the demands of clients, marketers and manufacturers and be aware of current trends.</p>
                <p><b>6. Motion Graphic Design: </b>is a somewhat new specialty for designers. Formally reserved for TV and film, technological advances have reduced production time and costs, making the art form more accessible and affordable. Now, motion graphics is one of the newest types of design and can be found across all digital platforms, which has created all sorts of new areas and opportunities.</p>
                <div class="blog-sub-inside-image">
                    <img src="images/graphics 8.png" alt="blog backgroun image" class="blog-bg">
                </div>
                <p>Motion graphics designers begin by developing storyboards and then bring their concepts to life with animation, video and traditional art. Depending on the industry, a strong working knowledge of marketing, coding and 3D modeling can be definite assets.</p>
                <P><B>7. Environmental Graphic Design: </B>Environmental graphic design visually connects people to places to improve their overall experience by making spaces more memorable, interesting, informative or easier to navigate.</P>
                <div class="blog-sub-inside-image">
                    <img src="images/graphics 9.png" alt="blog backgroun image" class="blog-bg">
                </div>
                <p>Wayfinding is a specific type of environmental graphic design that consists of strategic signage, landmarks and visual cues that help people identify where they are and where they need to go so they can get there without confusion.</p>
                <p>Environmental graphic design is a multidisciplinary practice that merges graphic, architectural, interior, landscape and industrial design. Designers collaborate with people in any number of these fields to plan and implement their designs. Because of that, designers typically have education and experience in both graphic design and architecture. They must be familiar with industrial design concepts and able to read and sketch architectural plans.</p>
                <p>Traditionally, environmental graphic design has produced static print pieces, but digital interactive displays continue to rise in popularity as a means of creating a more engaging experience.</p>
                <p><b>8. Art & Illustration Graphic Design: </b>Graphic art and illustration are often seen as being the same as graphic design, however, they’re each very different. Designers create compositions to communicate and solve problems, graphic artists and illustrators create original artwork. Their art takes a number of forms, from fine art to decoration to storytelling illustrations.</p>
                <p>Even though graphic art and illustration are not technically types of graphic design, so much is created for commercial use within the context of graphic design that you can’t talk about one without the others.</p>
