               <p>Digital Branding is the process of creating a strong, positive perception of a company, its products or services in the client’s mind by combining similar rudiments as logo, design, mission statement, and a consistent theme throughout all marketing communications.</p>
               <p>Branding is a marketing practice that helps individuals to differentiate your business’ products or service from others. Branding often involves creating elements such as a logo, mission statement, and design that is consistent throughout each marketing communication type.</p>
               <p>Effective branding helps companies differentiate themselves from their competitors and build a loyal customer base.</p>

               </div>
               <p>Product brandingis the application of branding strategy principles to a specific item or product. It’s the associating of a symbol, name, and design with a product to create a recognizable identity for that item.</p>
               <p>Personal Branding is the process of creating an identity for yourself as an individual or business. This involves developing a well-defined and consistent look, message, and presence online and offline.</p>
               <p>Corporate branding refers to the practice of promoting the brand name of a corporate entity with the company's image or identity and the way it's presented to customers</p>
               <p>Geographical branding focuses on the unique traits of a specific area or region as the selling point of a particular place and why you should visit</p>
               <h4>Why is Branding Important</h4>
               <p>A unique brand can have a huge impact on your bottom line by giving you a competitive advantage over your rivals and helping you acquire and retain customers at a much lower cost. In eCommerce, where new companies are springing up every day, an established brand can be an invaluable asset in bringing customers and generating profit.</p>
               <p>Regardless of whether you’re investing time and effort into crafting a compelling brand or paying no attention to it whatsoever, your business still has a brand. However, it may be completely different to how you intended to be seen.</p>
               <p>By carefully constructing your brand through stories, relationships, marketing messages and visual assets, you have the opportunity of shaping your customers’ expectations and creating a unique bond that goes beyond the buying-selling relationship.</p>
               <h4>Importance of Branding in e-Commerce</h4>
               <p>Branding is a complex process that requires careful planning and calculated approach. Ideally, you should have your branding strategy worked out before you launch your online store to avoid working backwards to try to aligned your store with customer expectations.</p>

               <p>Branding isn’t limited to just name and logo. It is a combination of characteristics and properties which have an effect on almost all of our senses to result in a uniform experience every time we have contact with it.</p>
               <p>Branding is made up of innumerable elements few of which are:</p>
               <div class="blog-sub-inside-image">
                    <img src="images/branding 4.png" alt="blog backgroun image" class="blog-bg">
               </div>
               <h4>Branding strategy</h4>
               <P>branding strategy is the long-term plan to achieve a series of long-term goals that ultimately result in the identification and preference of your brand by consumers. A successful branding strategy encompasses the brand’s mission, its promises to its customers, and how these are communicated.</P>
               <P>The main goal of a successful branding strategy is to let the world know that your brand exists, what purpose it has, and what defines it. A branding strategy is a fluid, long-term strategy that often requires being revisited over time based on its success.</P>
               <P>The success of a brand development strategy is not always easy to measure. Branding strategies often involve intangible, not-easily-quantified elements and–when planning this kind of strategy–it is important to decide from the onset how success will be measured.</P>
               <P>Many businesses use several brand strategies to reach their goals. Selecting the right strategies is important for your success. Follow these steps to find the best approach that fits your business.</P>

               </div>
               <P><b>Define Your Brand Identity.</b> Before you select the proper brand strategies for your business, you should define your brand identity. This involves asking yourself and others involved in the marketing and sales process a series of questions.</P>
               <p><b>Determine Your Brand Objectives.</b> Once you identify your brand identity and answer the key questions mentioned above, you should be able to determine your brand objectives. For example, your objective may be to position yourself as an industry leader in a set period of time or to increase customer interactions through reviews, website visits, or online product purchases.</p>
               <p><b>Define Your Brand’s Audience.</b> The best way to define your target audience is to consider what they’re interested in, where they’re located, their age, what they think of your brand currently, and how you will attract them to your services or products. Knowing your target market allows you to gather enough data to solidify your message and select the correct brand strategy that helps you appeal to your target audience.</p>
               <p><b>Consider Your Industry.</b> Each industry likely has different goals and objectives it would like to achieve. Each brand strategy has different things to offer your business. However, not every strategy will fit your specific industry</p>
               <p>To help you decide which brand strategies to choose, you may consider conducting a competitive analysis with the competitors in your industry. Conducting such an analysis will help you to uncover your opportunities and threats in your respective marketplace.</p>
               <p><b>Perfect Your Use of Visual Content.</b> Visuals are an important part of branding and marketing. In fact, according to a study conducted by HubSpot, visuals are processed and retained by individuals at faster rates than text. And visuals such as infographics are 3X as likely to be shared on social media over other forms of content.</p>
               <p>Visuals make up a large part of what your prospects and customers remember about your brand. Make sure your visuals are related to your overall brand theme and core values.</p>
               <p><b>Humanize Your Brand.</b> Making your brand more human means finding something to believe in and marketing that message to your prospects and customers.</p>
               <p>The best way to do this is to find unique solutions to your consumers’ problems by understanding that their problems have three parts: external, internal, and philosophical. When you identify their needs and problems, you can begin to weave a story into your marketing messages that provides your customers’ with value and makes them believe that you have the answers to their problems.</p>
               <p><b>Keep the Conversation Going.</b> A large part of positioning yourself as a strong brand includes getting people to talk about your brand and contributing to the conversation. Keeping the conversation going involves having a strong online presence that allows you to post and comment about the things that your brand cares about.</p>
               <P>Give back to your customers and thank them for remaining loyal to your brand. Direct interaction with your prospects and customers in person and via phone, email, or social media helps you to maintain and increase engagement, which leads to building a strong brand.</P>
