               <p><b>1.Personal Blogs:</b> Personal blogs are the pioneers of the blogging industry. When blogging emerged in the late 90s, it started with a personal blog. It paced-up as people began making their own blogs and penning down their thoughts, pieces of advice, opinions, and stories. Personal blogs are the most conventional and traditional form of blogs.</p>
               <h4>How to create a successful personal blog</h4>
               <p>If you want to build a personal blog, sign up for a domain on websites like WordPress and Blogger. Publish the blog on the internet and start writing blog posts. The blog posts should convey your passion, hobbies, pieces of advice, opinions, or your daily life to your readers.</p>
               <p>Find out if other blogs have the same kind of posts and messages. Comment on their blog posts and give a link to your own blog posts. This way, their readers will find out about your blog, and you’ll have an increase in web traffic.</p>
               <p><b>2.Business Blogs:</b> Blogs oriented toward businesses are called business blogs. The business bloggers tend to write on the topic related to the work they do for a living. A business blog aims to generate more leads for their businesses and make as many potential customers as possible. Unlike personal blogs, business blogs contain more professional ways of writings. They promote specific businesses and follow industry rules.</p>
               <p>The topics of the business blog posts will strictly be around the industry they are aligned with. Take an e-commerce business blog, for example. The blog posts will be something like, ‘How to Increase E-commerce Sales,’ ‘Top 10 Christmas Gifts You Can Buy Online,’ ‘XYZ Product Review,’ and other similar posts.</p>
               <h4>How to run a successful business blog</h4>
               <p>The main goal of a business blog is to generate and store leads from the visitors. To do so, you’ll have to write engaging blog posts about your business. After that, you’ll have to request the visitors to sign up for your mailing list. If a visitor signs up, you’ll end up getting a potential lead. That’s a successful transaction, for starters.</p>
               <p><b>3.Niche Blogs:</b> Niche blogs target specific topics instead of covering a set of different topics under its umbrella. You’ll find many niche-based blogs such as food blogs, basketball blogs, music blogs, car-racing blogs, content marketing blogs, Java blogs, movie blogs, health & fitness blogs, and many more.</p>
               <p>A niche blog is a perfect way to start your journey as a professional blogger. Just find something that you are passionate about and build a blog around it. It will only get better with time, and you’ll be able to generate revenues as well.</p>
               <h4>How to run a successful niche blog</h4>
               <p>First, you’ll have to define the niche you are passionate about. You can find more than 200 case studies of real-world niches from here. After this, define your target group. Target groups can be determined based on demographics, age-groups, gender, and personal likes and dislikes. Once you have defined your TG, the next step is to create content around your niche and promote your blog post to your TG. By doing so, you’ll have a far more success rate than usual business and personal blogs.</p>
               <P><b>4.Affiliate Blogs:</b> Affiliate blogs are built to generate commission through affiliate marketing. In affiliate marketing, you get paid a small percentage of the sale amount that’s been made through you. An affiliate blogger writes product reviews and asks their readers to purchase those products through their affiliate links. Once a transaction is made, the blogger gets a small kickback from it.</P>
               <p>Affiliate blogging is a huge industry. 81% of brands improve their marketing through various affiliate programs. It also helps bloggers to increase traffic. In fact, 84% of bloggers involve affiliate marketing techniques to grow their audience.</p>

               </div>
               <p><b>Blog consistently.</b> Having a good amount of content is necessary to gain a good SEO for your website. You should come up with quality content and blog consistently so that you can be up-to-date and never miss out on the opportunity of coming on the top search list.</p>
               <p><b>Research.</b> Before doing anything, it is important to do thorough research about it. You cannot just write about anything irrelevant and expect a good amount of traffic on your website. You need to search for hot topics and important things that people mostly search for.</p>
               <p><b>Find out the effective keywords.</b> Keywords are the way to improve your SEO and gain more viewers easily. When you write a blog it is important to use the keywords that are related to your website and blog. When people would search for that keyword, your website’s blog would appear.</p>
               <p><b>Interact with your viewers.</b> For effective blogging and to gain the trust and support of people, you should interact with your viewers and people who comment or like your blogs. In this way, you could build trust in people, attract them towards your brand, and know what the audience prefers.</p>
