               <h1 class="post-title">Target the right market </h1>
               <p>Choosing the right target market means narrowing down your audience to a group of people with similar characteristics, shared traits, and even niche hobbies and interests. Besides, not all brands can afford to target EVERYONE.</p>
               <div class="blog-sub-inside-image">

               </div>
               <p>Businesses must categorize their action areas while segmenting a specific market for their marketing efforts to be effective. They can only succeed if they correctly classify their target customers in the following four categories:</p>
               <p><b>1.Geographic:</b> A business can choose which market to focus on based on the location and type of products and services it provides. This target market segmentation considers that different consumer groups in a geographic area may require specific products or services.</p>
               <p>For example, if a company makes waterproof paint that keeps home exteriors safe during the monsoons, locations witnessing heavy rainfall throughout the year would be the best place to market it. Companies can find appropriate locations using the country code, postal code, area code, city, province, state, etc.</p>
               <p><b>2.Demographic:</b> A business must research the population before deciding on the ideal consumer group to target. It will allow the company to make well-informed decisions based on correct data. As a result, they can correctly define their markets and target customers of the appropriate age, gender, economic level, race, religion, education, marital status, etc. For example, if a company sells beer, it should plan its target market strategy for people aging 18 to 50.</p>
               <p><b>3.Psychographic:</b> This segmentation considers people’s lifestyle choices in an area where a company intends to run its advertising campaigns and introduce new products. Personality, attitude, interests, values, beliefs, and socioeconomic status are crucial factors to consider when identifying a potential consumer base.</p>
               <p>For example, a company planning to launch a pet product knows that its target customers will primarily be upper- and upper-middle-class people. As a result, its marketing efforts would focus on those people as their key clients.</p>
               <p><b>4.Behavioral:</b> A business must be aware of facts to determine how well its product would perform in a specific demographic or social setting. Understanding buying habits will let companies know how their products can meet consumer needs, both in terms of features and usability, which are the most critical issues in buying.</p>

               <p>So, you have done hard labor and finally finished making that attractive and killer product or service, good but this has not come to an end and your work is not done yet. Picking the target market is now the main task because you should know who your market is, who your audience is, what the pains and problems are. Your next step is very crucial that is nothing to find the right market for these products and services; you need to introduce your products or services in front of the right audience. So our next step is to identify the target market to get high ROI.</p>
               <h4>How to identify your ideal target market</h4>
               <p>If you fail to properly identify your right market then none of your marketing would work, not your ad, not your content, not your website, not your social media, nothing. If you are baffled in figuring out then follow these steps to get the best solution:</p>
               <p><b>Identify your market first:</b> Firstly, you should understand your niche well. You should ask yourself -why a customer would take interest in your products or services, what is something special you are dealing with? So, Proper research and segmentation of your market are necessary.</p>
               <p><b>Identify your target audience:</b> The target audience is nothing but your overall audience to whom you want to sell your products or services. Identify your audience according to your niche. It depends upon below factors:</p>
               <p><b>Demographics:</b> Demographics are decided according to your niche. You can identify your potential audience on the basis of factors like age, race, sex, and also includes social criteria like employment, education, religion, income, and marital status. Like if you are dealing with sports-related services like gymnastics or martial art then you can easily identify your potential audience by their age because an audience above 30 would take very less interest in these activities.</p>
               <p><b>Geographic location:</b> You can identify your potential audience according to your market location. Your audience may be from local, state, national, or international. For example, if you are dealing with sports-related products then your potential audience is more from your market location and if you are dealing with some online services like digital marketing courses then your potential audiences would be from all across the world.</p>
               <p><b>Nature, behavior and Psychology:</b> The target market is strictly based on the attitudes, emotions, beliefs, and Psychology of the audience. You should be aware of the audience’s interest like what they like or dislike, what are new trends come in the market they are looking for. If your market is located in a particular local area then you should have the idea of the above things</p>
               <p>So, deeper research of demographics, geographic location, and nature & behavior are a must in the identification of target audience and it totally depends upon your niche. You can use some digital marketing tools like Google Analytics or Facebook insight for this.</p>
               <p><b>Do SWOT and PESTLE Analysis:</b> It is a powerful tool whether you are going to start a new company or you have an existing company. SWOT analysis is a technique to identify the strength, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of your organization. It will tell you what’s working well and what’s working badly.</p>
               <p><b>Analyze your top competitors:</b> If you want to get wider traffic then you should know who your competitors are and what you are doing unique from the competitors. It is necessary because it will tell you where you are leading or lagging. So, analyze to top competitors' strategy properly to get the target market and reach the wider audiences after that.</p>
               <p><b>Use digital marketing techniques and tools:</b> With the help of digital marketing, you can easily pick your target market and audience. Techniques like Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Search Media Marketing (SEM), Social Media Optimization (SMO), E-mail marketing, Content marketing, and much more are used to promote and optimize your businesses or services.</p>
               <p>Tools used to track the nature and behavior of existing and new audiences are Google Analytics, Google Search Console, Facebook Insight, and Hotjar. These powerful tools will help you a lot in getting the right target audience.</p>
               <p><b>Filter and Segmentation:</b> You should do a funnel approach where you can easily filter and segment the audiences. Like if you are product or service is specifically based on a gender basis then you can narrow your audiences easily. Similarly, you can do the filter on the basis of age and income level.  Your market segmentation should be measurable, identifiable, definable, actionable, substantial.</p>
